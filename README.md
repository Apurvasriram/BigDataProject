# Driving Insights from the urban jungle: Harnessing the power of Big Data to solve NYC's Parking Violation Puzzle!

NYC is busy fast-paced city. The  objective of this project is to develop a data-driven approach that tackles the issue of parking violations in NYC. Through predictive analytics, we can identify
specific factors that contribute to parking violations, such as time of day, day of the week, parking restrictions, and neighborhood characteristics. Armed with this
knowledge, city officials and law enforcement agencies can optimize parking enforcement efforts, strategically allocate resources, and implement targeted
interventions to curb violations effectively.
